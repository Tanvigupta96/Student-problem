# Student-problem

##The Issue 
Often the issues in colleges are left unheard even when batches of students pass out ! Since suggestion boxes are barely opened, the same scenario is followed year after year.  Feedback for improvement and enhancement never reach the authorities. 
In this app dominating world, Mobile app penetration across the globe has been increasing at a significant rate .It becomes handy and easy for everyone to raise and manage issues which are just one click away.
This app aims to impact a critical aspect of student life, i.e.- raising concerns and grievances faced by current students and alumni and also setting up an open communication channel for both college authorities and students.
 Let's be the CHANGE..!!

##Solution
- Our aim is to develop an android application that gives students as well as alumni an opportunity to voice their thoughts openly and get community support. 
- A user can post about issues he/she faced in the college that will appear in the common feed of everyone tuned into the app
- There will be an option to post anonymously in case the user does not want to reveal his/ her identity
- A post can be tagged with relevant hashtags / subtopic tags 
- Users can view posts related to a particular tag while browsing the feed (categories)
- Users can upvote/ downvote and comment on posts in the feed
- We plan to implement a reddit inspired layout and points will be rewarded to users who comment the most or whose posts get the most upvotes ( just like karma )
- In this way, we plan to motivate users to respond to posts 
- The app will also display monthly top 10 posts ie the HOT TOPICS that will be forwarded to the authorities for consideration. 
- If the authority decides to takes up the issue the post will be upgraded to a separate feed where users can view the status of the issue ( eg : seen , under consideration, resolved etc) 
- The app will also display analytics regarding the number of problems solved and the overall impact of an issue.
